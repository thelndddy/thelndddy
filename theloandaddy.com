Storefront payday loans are available in 36 states. Borrowers in some of them pay twice as much for the same loans that comparable customers get in other states. Pew's research indicates that a state's limit on interest rates is the key factor driving loan pricing. The four largest payday lenders in the United States charge similar prices within a given state, with rates set at or near the maximum allowed by law. But in states with higher or no interest rate limits, the same companies charge comparable borrowers far more for essentially the same small-loan product.
