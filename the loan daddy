Policymakers in states with conventional payday lending can reduce the harm caused by unaffordable payments and noncompetitive prices by implementing Pew's policy recommendations:

Limit payments to an affordable percentage of a borrower's periodic income. Pew's research indicates that monthly payments above 5 percent of gross monthly income are unaffordable.
Spread costs evenly over the life of the loan.
Guard against harmful repayment or collection practices.
Require concise disclosures that reveal both periodic and total costs.
States should continue to set maximum allowable charges on loans for those with poor credit. In states that have permitted higher interest rates than Colorado's, storefronts have proliferated, with no obvious additional benefit to consumers.
